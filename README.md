# Dublin Guide

### Kilmainham Gaol
![alt Jail](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Kilmainham2.jpg)


This jail is by far the best place to visit while in Dublin. You will learn a lot about the Irish History. A lot of [movies]((https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Kilmainham%20Jail,%20Dublin,%20County%20Dublin,%20Ireland)) where filmed here

You need to book your tickets online and IN ADVANCE because it is always sold out!
Tickets can be bought [here](http://kilmainhamgaol.admit-one.eu/index.php?s=OPW_KILM&p=calendar&ev=TOUR&language=ENG)

### Guinness Storehouse

Tickets available [here](https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en)

Visiting the house of the Irish Gold is a must! You get a chance to learn the history of the Guinness family and how Guinness is brewed. They will also teach you how to pour the perfect pint of Guinness and at the end of the visit you get a 360 view over the city in a bar and of course they give you a pint of Guinness to enjoy the view! This will take you at least half a day to visit.
